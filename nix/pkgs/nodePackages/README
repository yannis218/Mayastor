Nix expressions contain a couple of npm packages, but it's just a fraction
of what's available through `npm install`. So here we define nix expressions
with help of the `node2nix` tool to build whatever npm packages that we might
need. Currently that is just the `semistandard` npm module required for
checking JS coding style and common errors. It is used in pre-commit hook,
nix-shell environment, mayastor buildenv container and by the github actions.

Edit `node-packages.json` if you want to add/remove npm modules and run
the `generate.sh` script to regenerate nix expressions. Assuming that
mayastor overlay has been imported, you can refer to npm module as
`nodePackages.<name-of-the-npm-module>` in the nix files.
