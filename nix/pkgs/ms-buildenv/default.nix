# When we use contents []; what in effect will happen is that during the
# generation of the layers, /bin /include and /lib gets"flattend" into a
# single directory. (lack of a better term sorry). What this means is that
# if we have pkgs.A and pkgs.B it would yield, typically;
#
# /store/nix/<hash>-A/{bin,lib,include}
# /store/nix/<hash>-B/{bin,lib,include}
#
# After we have a "contents" all outputs get stored in /include and /lib
# this is fine, however, some of the team would like to have an actual nix
# environment, that is to say, the nix tools and nix-env -q remain working.
#
# In the case of mayastor for example this is exactly what we want. We have
# /bin/mayastor and a couple of /libs.
#
# To keep the existing derivations working, nix-style we must construct a
# user profile as you normally would have if you where running nix.
#
# A user profile is a symlinked together directory /nix/var/nix/profiles/<name>
# the construction of the profile is done by nix-env so we emulate that within
# docker layer cake, by importing the output derivations in to the nix-store
# after building the packages.
